There is an All-in-One Store that sells everything from groceries, medicines, clothes, books, music CDs, imported commodities etc. Standard tax rates apply on these commodities as below. 


-    5% on medicines and Food
-    5% on clothes below 1000 INR and 12% above 1000INR purchase
-    3% on music cds/dvds
-    Flat 18% on the imported commodities.
-    Books are exempted from tax.
-    On every purchase I get a receipt that has the below information :
-    Date and Time of purchase
-    List of commodities, each with their final price, tax amount with the applicable rate
-    Total amount payable
-    Additionally, a 5% discount is applied by the store if the bill exceeds 2000INR. 
The bill is sorted in the ascending order of the commodity names.
