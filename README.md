# all-in-one-store-python-
Python program to simulate store billing process with pre-defined set of taxing rules.

There is an All-in-One Store that sells everything from groceries, medicines, clothes, books, music CDs, imported commodities etc. Standard tax rates apply on these commodities as below. 


-    5% on medicines and Food
-    5% on clothes below 1000 INR and 12% above 1000INR purchase
-    3% on music cds/dvds
-    Flat 18% on the imported commodities.
-    Books are exempted from tax.
-    On every purchase I get a receipt that has the below information :
-    Date and Time of purchase
-    List of commodities, each with their final price, tax amount with the applicable rate
-    Total amount payable
-    Additionally, a 5% discount is applied by the store if the bill exceeds 2000INR. 
The bill is sorted in the ascending order of the commodity names.


You can either run the .py file available in the python 3.7+ on your machine. Or copy the code available in the same code and paste it into the 'https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler' site and run it as it is.
